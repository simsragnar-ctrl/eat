# Time2Eat - Bamenda Food Delivery Platform

This README.md serves as a detailed prompt for designing and building a food ordering web application tailored for Bamenda, Cameroon. It outlines the vision, features, tech stack, user roles, database schema, installation steps, and step-by-step prompts to build the app. Use this as a guide to ensure the app is modern, user-friendly, and scalable. Focus on reusable code (e.g., shared components, functions, classes), good practices (e.g., MVC pattern in PHP), and minimal code solutions. Keep code comments minimal‚Äîonly for complex logic or non-obvious sections.

The app connects customers with local restaurants and delivery riders for seamless ordering, with real-time tracking and affiliate features. Ensure full functionality: data import/export, consistent design across pages (including dashboards), role-based login redirection, payment processing, notifications, search/cart management, order management (cancellations/refunds), ratings/reviews, affiliate codes, security, logging, and backups. Public-facing pages are limited to index, browse, and about; other functionality is in role-specific dashboards. Admin-editable contact info (e.g., email, phone, address) appears in footer/about page.

## üé® Design

Clean, intuitive mobile first UI/UX with high-quality images of local Bamenda dishes (e.g., ndol√©, eru). Use warm colors (reds/oranges) for CTAs, neutrals for backgrounds, sans-serif fonts (Inter/Poppins), and mobile-first layouts (320px up) with Tailwind CSS (`tw-` prefix, `@layer components` for customs, `tailwind-merge` for class conflicts). Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading), ensure touch-friendly buttons (min 44px), swipeable carousels, collapsible sidebars, and WCAG AA accessibility. Test responsiveness with `container mx-auto`, `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`, and `hover:tw-scale-105` for subtle animations. use glasmorphism, visual hierarchy

## üöÄ Features (Prompt for Implementation)

Build these core features with an emphasis on security, performance, and mobile responsiveness:
- **Multi-role System**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using PHP sessions or JWT for Customer, Vendor, Delivery Rider, and Admin.
- **Real-time Order Tracking**: Use PHP with polling (or WebSockets via Ratchet if feasible) for live order status and delivery progress with map integration.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first; test on devices from 320px width up.
- **Secure Authentication**: Use PHP's password_hash, email verification, and role-specific dashboard redirection (e.g., customer to order page, admin to analytics).
- **Real-time Updates**: Browser alerts or push notifications (e.g., OneSignal if using JS); email/SMS for order confirmations/status changes (Twilio/SendGrid).
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable with manifest.json, service worker for offline menu browsing, and push notifications.
- **Header Enhancements**: Browse icon in nav linking to browse page for quick dish/restaurant search.

## üîß Installation (Simplified for Shared Hosting/Local)

Focus on easy setup without Git or advanced tools. Assume PHP/MySQL hosting (e.g., cPanel, local XAMPP). Build an installation file (ZIP archive with installer script) for compatibility.

1. **Build Installation File**: Package project into Time2Eat-v1.0.zip with all folders, .env.example, database.sql, import scripts, and installer.php. Installer checks PHP 8+, prompts for DB credentials, creates .env, imports SQL schema, sets up admin user, configures permissions, and self-deletes for security. Use relative paths, detect hosting type (shared/VPS), handle permissions via PHP (e.g., chmod). Test on XAMPP, HostGator, cloud (Heroku-like, PHP-focused).

2. **Download/Upload Files**: Manually download ZIP, extract to server/local directory.

3. **Run Installer**: Visit http://yourdomain/installer.php; follow prompts to configure .env (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, MAP_API_KEY).

4. **Set Up Database**: Installer auto-creates database if permitted; otherwise, use phpMyAdmin with database.sql.

5. **Complete Setup**: Installer verifies setup, redirects to homepage. For shared hosting, FTP upload ZIP and extract.

6. **Test**: Visit http://localhost/Time2Eat or domain; fix permissions (e.g., 755 for folders).

7. **Troubleshooting**: Check PHP error logs; ensure PDO, GD (images), ZipArchive (exports) extensions.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Prompts for Building the App

Use these step-by-step prompts to build the app iteratively. Each prompt is designed to be self-contained and detailed for execution in a single Augment request, incorporating relevant context from the tech stack, features, design, user roles, database schema, and best practices (e.g., MVC pattern, DRY/SOLID principles, mobile-first Tailwind CSS with `tw-` prefix, minimal comments, PHP 8+, Composer for dependencies). Start with core features, then expand. Aim for iterative builds: core auth first, then features. Review generated code for security, reusability, and alignment with the overall app vision.

The Root Cause: File Loading Order
The core of the problem is the order in which your application loads its files.

The constants like DB_HOST, DB_NAME, etc., are defined in the file e:\Wamp64\www\Eat\config\config.php. This file is responsible for reading your .env file and making those values available to the rest of your application as PHP constants.
The error occurs because the code that uses DB_HOST (in database.php) is executed before the code that defines DB_HOST (in config/config.php) has been loaded.
Looking at your e:\Wamp64\www\Eat\bootstrap\app.php file, it loads config/app.php, but it doesn't appear to load config/config.php. The application proceeds to run the router and controllers without ever loading the essential database constants.

How to Fix It (Conceptual)
To resolve this, you need to ensure config/config.php is loaded very early in the application's lifecycle, before any database connection is attempted. A logical place to include it would be within bootstrap/app.php, right after the ROOT_PATH is defined and before the main Application class is run.
